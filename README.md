Breakout
========

A Python port of the classic Atari game Breakout for the Atari 2600

I tried to make the game as similar to the original. I matched color scheme, point values, triggers for increasing ball speed and paddle shrinking to one-half its size after the ball brakes through the red row and hit the upper wall. High scores are stored locally. Ball and paddle speed still needs to be adjusted. Possible extension to the original is to add timer for speedrunning and for comparing same two scores.

Controls
 - Left and right arrow keys to move the paddle
 - Space bar to launch the ball
 - Enter to start the game
